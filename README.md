This is a machine learning project about predicting the price of wines with the wine's scores (points). In the first part, I compared the performance of three different models, and found that for different situations a different model performs the best. The best model is always the one that captures the right relationship between the predictor and the dependent variable. In the second part, I used various predictors to predict wine price using multiple linear regression model.
