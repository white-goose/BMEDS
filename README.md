## Final Project

This is a machine learning project about predicting the price of wines with the wine's scores (points). 

In the first part, we compared the performance of three different models, and found that for different situations a different model performs the best. The best model is always the one that captures the right relationship between the predictor and the dependent variable. 

In the second part, we used various predictors to predict wine price using multiple linear regression model.
